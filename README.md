# cargo-instruments

Easily generate [Instruments] traces for your rust crate.

`cargo-instruments` is the glue between cargo and Xcode's bundled profiling
suite. It allows you to easily profile any binary in your crate, generating
files that can be viewed in the Instruments app.

## Installation

### brew

```bash
brew install cargo-instruments
```

### Building from Source

First, ensure that you are running macOS, with Cargo, Xcode, and the Xcode
Command Line Tools installed; then install with

```bash
cargo install cargo-instruments
```

## Use

### basic usage

`cargo-instruments` requires a binary target to run. By default, it will try to
build the current crate's `main.rs`. You can specify an alternative binary by
using the `--bin` or `--example` flags, or a benchmark target with the `--bench`
flag.

_Generate a new trace file_ (by default saved in `/target/instruments`)

```sh
$ cargo instruments [-t template] [--bin foo | --example bar] [--out out_file]
```

_Open the file in Instruments.app_ (or pass `--open` to open automatically)

```sh
$ open target/instruments/my_bin_YYYY-MM-DD-THH:MM:SS.trace
```

### Templates

Instruments has the concept of 'templates', which describe sets of dtrace probes
that can be enabled. `cargo-instruments` will use the "[Time
Profiler][time profiler]", which collects CPU core and thread use.

### examples

```sh
# View all args and options
$ cargo instruments --help
```

```sh
# profile the main binary with the Allocations template
$ cargo instruments -t alloc
```

```sh
# profile examples/my_example.rs, with the default template,
# for 10 seconds, and open the trace when finished
$ cargo instruments --example my_example --limit 10000 --open
```
